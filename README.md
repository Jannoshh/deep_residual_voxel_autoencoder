# deep_residual_voxel_autoencoder (EfficientNet3D)

Repository for EfficientNets extended to 3D classification and the implementation of an EfficientNet Autoencoder in Tensorflow.

Code follows after paper was accepted to the CIRP Design 2022 Conference

In the domain of computer vision, deep residual neural networks like EfficientNet have set new standards in terms of robustness and accuracy. In this work, we present a deep residual 3D autoencoder based on the EfficientNet architecture for transfer learning. For this purpose, we adopted EfficientNet to 3D problems like voxel models derived from a STEP file.
