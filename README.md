In the domain of computer vision, deep residual neural networks like EfficientNet have set new standards in terms of robustness and accuracy. In this work, we present a deep residual 3D autoencoder based on the EfficientNet architecture for transfer learning. For this purpose, we adopted EfficientNet to 3D problems like voxel models derived from a STEP file.
